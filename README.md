## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 game board. Each cell is numbered as follows:
   
   1 | 2 | 3

    4 | 5 | 6

    7 | 8 | 9

3. The current player should enter a number to place their symbol (X or O) on an empty cell.

4. Players take turns, and the objective is to create a line of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If a player achieves this, they win the game.

5. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

6. When the game ends, an option to play again or exit is presented.
